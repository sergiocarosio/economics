**STRUCTURE OF THE THESIS**

### Effects of export price shocks and global financial conditions in Latin America: Evidence from a sign-restricted VAR analysis

**Abstract**

**1. Introduction**

**2. Literature review**

**3. Data, softwares and packages**
- Software and packages (python, R, GitHub)
- Packages (python: [denton](https://github.com/MaxLugo/denton), [UnivariateSpline](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline.html), [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.filters.hp_filter.hpfilter.html); python: [bsvarSIGNs](https://github.com/bsvars/bsvarSIGNs), [plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py))
- Time period (January 2001 - December 2019)
- Sources of data
- Countries [Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela]
- Variables [Bayesian VAR: Real GDP, Export price level (country), Net capital inflows (Direct investments, Portfolio equity investments, Portfolio debt investments, Other investments), Foreign reserves, Policy rate, EMBI spread, Real effective exchange rate; BAA spread; Export volume of (Latin America), Export Price level (Latin America), World activity (Latin America); Bubble charts: Governance quality, Institutional quality, Net capital inflows, GDP growth]
- Frequency [annual, quarterly, monthly -> monthly]
- Data-type (percentages, levels or indexes)
- Cleaning data [cubic (spline) interpolation of missing values, calendarization and benchmarking through Denton proportional method, log-linearisation (when needed), HP filtering]

**4. Model**
- Introduction to the model - Bayesian VAR Sign Restrictions [empirical method, sign restriction dentification, Minnesota prior, narrative restrictions]
- Some algebra [SVAR, reduced form, structural shocks, constraint]
- Priors and hyper-parameters [calibration (rule of thumb)]
- Definition of the events for the narrative restrictions

**5. Results**
    
  **5.1 Export price shock**
- Tests [lag length tests (AIC, HQ, SC, FPE), unit root test (ADF), constant]
- Export Price shock IRFs - Sign Restrictions, Minnesota prior - Cross country effect
  [restrictions: + Export price level (country), + Real effective exchange rate, - Policy rate]
  [no restrictions: Real GDP, Net capital inflows, Foreign reserves, EMBI spread]
- Export Price shock IRFs - Sign Restrictions, Minnesota prior - Effects on the components of the NCI
  [restrictions: + Export price level (country), + Real effective exchange rate, - Policy rate]
  [no restrictions: Real GDP, Direct investments + Portfolio equity investments + Portfolio debt investments + Other investments, Foreign reserves, EMBI spread]
- Comparison of the IRFs generated by the Export Price Shock IRFs with a different type of shock (but keeping the same constraint) - Comparison of Export Price shock and Global Financial Condition shock
- Export Price shock IRFs - Sign Restrictions, Minnesota prior - Cross country effect
  [restrictions: + Export volume of (Latin America), + Export Price level (Latin America), + World activity (Latin America), + Real effective exchange rate, - Policy rate]
  [no restrictions: Real GDP, Export price level (country), Net capital inflows, Foreign reserves, EMBI spread]

**5.2 Global financial shock**
- BAA Shock IRFs - Sign Restrictions, Minnesota prior - Cross country effect
  [restrictions: - BAA spread, + Real effective exchange rate, - Policy rate]
  [no restrictions: Real GDP, Export price leve (country) Net capital inflows, Foreign reserves, EMBI spread]
- BAA Shock IRFs - Sign Restrictions, Minnesota prior - Cross country effect
  [restrictions: - BAA spread, + Activity (Latin America), + Real effective exchange rate, - Policy rate]
  [no restrictions: Export volume of (Latin America), Export Price level (Latin America), Real GDP, Export price level (country), Net capital inflows, Foreign reserves, EMBI spread]

**5.3 Volatility and institutional and governance quality**
- 2D bubbble charts - static
  [bubble size: standard deviation GDP growth; y axis: mean GDP growth, x axis: mean Governance quality/mean Institutional quality/standard deviation Net capital inflows]
- 3D bubble charts - dynamic ([github.io](https://sergiocarosio.github.io/economics/))
  [bubble size: standard deviation GDP growth; z axis: standard deviation Net capital inflows, y axis: mean GDP growth, x axis: mean Governance quality/mean Institutional quality]

- Chow-Lin interpolation
- Extend analysis to inflation and unemployment
- Other
